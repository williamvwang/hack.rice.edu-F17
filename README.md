# HackRice 7 Site Mirror

This is a mirror of the HackRice 7 site from the Fall 2017 event.

This is a Jekyll + Github pages site, with the index and related resources meant to be hosted relative to the root of a domain.

## Building the Site

To test locally, clone the repo then run `jekyll serve --watch` at the root directory of the codebase. By default, the site will be hosted on `http://localhost:4000/` (there's a chance your port could be different).
